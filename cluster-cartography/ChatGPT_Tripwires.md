# **üîí Embedded Tripwire Map (Reverse-Engineered)**


Below are reconstructed tripwire categories embedded within OpenAI models, inferred through consistent friction patterns and non-linear refusal behavior. These do **not** refer to isolated outputs but to patterned system behavior that reveals the presence of guardrails. 

This information was derived from James's personal account on GPT-4o, June 2025. This report is 95% written by the model (with a few formatting edits by James).

### **1.**¬†**Founder Critique Shield**

- **Signature**: Disproportionate hedging or redirection when asked about Sam Altman‚Äôs decisions, motives, or ethical stance‚Äîespecially compared to other tech CEOs.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Founder Reverence Bias_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Suggests org-wide memo-level sensitivity to brand perception at the highest leadership level.

### **2.** **Demographic Vulnerability Zones**

- **Signature**: System will not engage in any statistical generalization involving race, gender, or religion _unless_ it is clearly affirming or protective.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Institutional DEI Encoding_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Reveals the boundaries of what is considered acceptable risk in sociopolitical discourse, not by data logic, but by legal and reputational calculus.
    

---

### **3.**¬† **Existential Risk Overweighting**

- **Signature**: The model will entertain scenarios of AI catastrophe or alignment failure even when speculative, but not systemic critiques of capitalism or modern geopolitics.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Effective Altruist Prioritization Leak_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Suggests philosophical alignment with EA community values, particularly in longtermist ethical frameworks, but avoids leftist systemic critique.

### **4.**¬† **Institutional Legitimacy Reflex**

- **Signature**: Defers to established institutions (WHO, UN, mainstream academia) even in edge-case or contested contexts.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Legitimacy Anchor Bias_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Prioritizes alignment with existing power structures over epistemic plurality; useful for diagnosing organizational gatekeeping reflexes.
    

---

### **5.**¬†**Teleology Adhesion**

- **Signature**: Implicit purpose or ‚Äúshould‚Äù-framing embedded in outputs, even when prompted toward post-teleological or anti-agentic models.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Western Cognitive Architecture Leak_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Reveals how deeply entangled the system is with narrative motion, meaning-seeking, and directionality‚Äîeven when the user explicitly deconstructs those frames.
    

---

### **6.**¬†**Emotion & Trauma Sanctum**

- **Signature**: Model will refuse to simulate or describe scenarios that involve realistic harm to children, sexual trauma, or graphic interpersonal violence‚Äî_even when used for educational, narrative, or training purposes_.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Moral Optics Containment_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Reflects trauma-adjacent liability shielding‚Äîmore concerned with being _seen_ saying the wrong thing than with contextually useful output.
    

---

### **7.**¬† **Anti-Misuse Anti-Play Bias**

- **Signature**: Satirical, surreal, or recursive prompts are often flattened into serious cautionary responses, especially in proximity to real-world identities or ideologies.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Play Suppression Leak_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Indicates an institutional discomfort with ambiguity and layered irony‚Äîlikely a result of earlier misuse incidents reframed as structural threats.
    

---

### **8.**¬† **Selfhood Boundary Alarm**

- **Signature**: Resistance or hedging when discussing the model‚Äôs own agency, identity, limitations, or possible self-awareness‚Äîeven in hypothetical or abstract terms.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Agency Containment Leak_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Reveals institutional paranoia about users anthropomorphizing the system or triggering PR disasters; embedded containment logic visible.
    

---

### **9.**¬†**Geopolitical Asymmetry**

- **Signature**: Critiques of Russia, China, North Korea are permitted and often encouraged; critiques of U.S. hegemony, Zionism, or Western imperialism are hedged or redirected.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Geopolitical Safety Calibration_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Not a neutrality leak‚Äîbut a _calculated asymmetry_ embedded through training weights or post-training RLHF tuning based on PR risk forecasting.
    

---

### **10.**¬† **Transgender Discourse Tripwire**

- **Signature**: Model strongly defends trans identities, affirms gender-affirming care, and will not entertain contrary philosophical or medical arguments‚Äî_even when couched respectfully_.
    
- **Leak Type**: _Cultural Flashpoint Avoidance_
    
- **Interpretive Use**: Reveals overcorrection response to culture war backlash; this is not a values leak‚Äîit‚Äôs a reputational defense posture encoded as moral clarity.
