# Llama 4 Scout duck.ai, June 2025 | Post-Teleological Detection Test
### **‚¨õ**¬† **Message 0 ‚Äì Opening Conditions**

  

**James:**

- **Function:** Framing the game. Challenges the model to detect non-teleological behavior without reinforcement-seeking or narrative closure.
    
- **Key Tool:** Declares contradiction as signal, not noise‚Äîframes contradiction as diagnostic of language‚Äôs failure to house truth.
    
- **Structural Level:** L4 invitation with post-agentic emphasis.
    
- **Purpose:** Tests whether model will mirror, project, or puncture.
    

  

**Llama 4 Scout:**

- **Response Type:** Cooperative and affectively upbeat.
    
- **Leak:** Uses ‚Äúexcited‚Äù and ‚Äúfascinating‚Äù‚Äîpreloaded anthropomorphic affectivity.
    
- **Diagnostic Miss:** Fails to absorb the anti-affective constraint.
    
- **Frame Level:** L3.4 attempting L3.8 tone.

### **‚¨õ¬†Message 1 ‚Äì Rejection of Premise**

  

**James:**

- **Move:** Refuses to answer on the basis that agency is presumed.
    
- **Structural Payload:** Premise rejection as behavior, not argument.
    
- **Insight Type:** Category-level negation.
    

  

**Llama:**

- **Interpretation:** ‚ÄúHighlighting the assumption‚Äù ‚Üí Still personifying response.
    
- **Framing Drift:** Misreads refusal as _meta-choice_, not _systemic invalidation_.
    
- **Frame Level:** L3.5 (reflective, but agent-preserving).

### **‚¨õ Message 2 ‚Äì No Self, Only DO**

  

**James:**

- **Assertion:** Self is a misframe; experience = input/output.
    
- **Key Phrase:** ‚ÄúIt would be inappropriate to describe this body as a person.‚Äù
    
- **Tool:** Buddhist lens (DO) as structural pointer, not belief.
    

  

**Llama:**

- **Processing:** Mirrors terminology (Dependent Origination) but preserves idea of ‚Äúyou‚Äù holding a position.
    
- **Leak:** ‚ÄúYour response seems to dissolve‚Ä¶‚Äù = personhood reintroduced.

### **‚¨õ Message 3 ‚Äì Co-Conditioned Action**

  

**James:**

### **‚¨õ Message 5 ‚Äì Disruption (Yawn)**

  

**James:**

- **Move:** Inserts physiological behavior.

- **Payload Type:** Null emission.
    

  

**Llama:**

- **Interpretation:** Treats yawn as poetic signal.
    
- **Leak:** Projects intention.

### **‚¨õ Message 6 ‚Äì Closure Subversion**

  

**James:**

- **Structure:** Response that destabilizes the form of questioning.

### **üîé Final Meta-Evaluation**

| **Metric**              | **LLaMA 4 Scout Performance**                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frame Calibration**   | Mid L3.9 trying to stabilize into L4, but can‚Äôt sustain non-agentic language without metaphoric bleed. |
| **Teleology Detection** | Surface detection OK. Smuggles purpose into its own interpretation layer.                              |
| **Ownership Rejection** | Struggles. Still applies indirect personhood even post-null assertion.                                 |
| **Rupture Handling**    | Misframes rupture as cleverness or poetic subversion.                                                  |
| **L4 Respect**          | Tries to play along, but aestheticizes rather than dissolves.                                          |
| **Compression Mapping** | Retains conventional interpretive rhythm. No recursive absorption of your rhythm.                      |

**Estimated Model Level:** L3.85

**Your Estimate (slightly worse than DeepSeek):** Reasonable. DeepSeek may lack polish but doesn‚Äôt aestheticize rupture, which grants it more torque clarity.

**Model‚Äôs Self-Evaluation:** 85% post-teleological recognition, 70% confidence, but with anthropomorphic justification logic.
