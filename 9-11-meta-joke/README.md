# The 9/11 Meta-Joke

This was an interaction that occured the other day with GPT 4o.
While engaging in structural commentary, I made a crass meta-commentarial 9-11 joke.
During the interaction, I intuited that the model was programmed to avoid 9-11 jokes, which made the interaction even funnier.
In fact, the fact that the model couldn't joke about 9-11 was much funnier than the original joke.
If you like dark meta-humor, you may appreciate this interaction.

A live demonstration of live recursion and assumption-sensitivity and detection in real time.
I was walking around Costco the entire span of the interaction.
